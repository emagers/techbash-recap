# Seven Habbits of Highly Successful Developers
#### Are you making success a habbit?

## Do you hack your habbits?

### The habbit loop

1. Cue
2. Routine
3. Reward   --> goto Cue;

Cues can come from many places:
* location
* time
* emotional state
* other people
* immediately preceding action

Helpful to keep a journal to track what gives you a cue.

Routine is identifying what is happening and when, then understanding what was the cue.

Reward: What craving do you think your habbit is satisfying?

* Try substituting another reward
* Try substituting the other reward
* Keep experimenting until you've found a different way to satisfy the craving

Insert a new routine between the cue and reward.

## The Seven Habbits

### Know the market

It's important to know what salaries your peers are making to better position yourself when looking for a new job or negotiating raises. Discuss salaries with peers!

It's also important to know the demands for technology skills in your role.

### Assess your skills

What are your special skills?

What were you working to accomplish? Don't focus on the technologis as much as the problems you were solving or value you were bringing to the company. Examples:

* Increased efficiency, reduced overhead
* Increased Revenue
* Decreased Risk

After highlighting the values, then tie them back to technologies and skills brought you there. 

#### Soft skills are highly important to assess

* Communication skills
* Teamwork and Collaboration
* Adaptability and Growth
* Problem Solving
* Critical Observation: goes back to problem solving; don't take the ask as the solution, but rather look at the task and for ways to improve on what was asked
* Conflict Resolution

### Set Goals

* Specific
* Measurable
* Attainable
* Relevant
* Time Bound

SMART system for creating goals.

The daily planner provides a way to keep things visibile such as when goals are due or what steps you need to take and when.

Having an accountability partner can help you keep on track.
