# Impostor Syndrome

## What is it?

A thought pattern in which a person diminishes their own accomplishments, often attributing their success to luck. This often leads to feelings of being a fraud and a constant fear of being "found out."

Coined by researchers in the 70s whose study found the following:

* No internal sense of success
* Generalized anxiety
* Lack of self confidence
* Depression
* Frustration related to inability to live up to own high standards

### Contributing factors in childhood:

* Being considered sensitive or charming in comparison to an intelligent sibling
* Being considered perfect or effortlessly talented

### Societal factors:

* Women are more likely than men to have low expectations for success in many tasks
* Low societal expectations conflict with experiences of success

### Suggested therapies:

* Group therapy with others with impostor syndrome
* Interrupt ritualistic behaviors
   * Think positively when you start to realize the "impostor" thoughts
* Think of the people you feel like you have fooled and imagine "confessing," then imagine what their responses would be.
* Keep a record of positive feedback
   * Note how feedback is deflected, not internalized
   * Work on listening, taking in, and accepting it
* Role-play the opposite of "I'm not bright"
   * Those most resistant usually have the most to gain
   * Most helpful in a group therapy setting
* Take the risk to "be yourself"
   * Try not to do or say things for approval only
   * Expected negative consequences don't come
   * More likely to accept compliments as authentic

### Limitations of the study: 

* Only women studied, more needed on men
* Large focus on gender binary
* White researchers; mostly white participants
* Intersectionality coined 11 years later
* Many marginalized groups not covered

## Normalizing Impostor Syndrome

## You have it, now what?

### Track your accomplishments and external praise

* Focus on what you did, not just the outcome
    * ~~I got the job~~ I successfully completed the code challenge
* Don't forget to review these once in a while
* Useful when advocating for yourself
    * Negotiating for promotions, raises, updating resumes

Write down any compliment or positive feedback you have received. Note who gave the feedback, how did you feel about it, how did you respond?

Review this feedback for trends and begin to respond intentionally. 

### Catalog your skills

List out your skills; assets you brbing to the table (current or future role). Consider your past experiences (how were you successful in the past?).

Stress these skills in your interviews, remember them in your day-to-day. You are an asset to your team and to your company, even if you are new (which is an asset all on it's own).

### Hype squad

A group of people in your corner who build you up when you need confidence, push you to succeed, and listen to you vent. 

### Build up others

There's huge benefits in becoming a mentor. You know more than you think you do and your experiences are valuable to those who are facing the struggles you have been through.

   * Remind others that they are not alone

### Embrace it

'Fake it 'til you make it' when there's no end to the 'making it'? Just keep faking it.

No one really knows what they're doing. They're all just trying to make it. You're not alone.

#### How do you separate healthy humility from impostor syndrome?
